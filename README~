For this project, we have chosen to develop an HF network 
simulation framework based on the public-domain network 
simulation framework known as Network Simulator 2, or ns-2, 
an object-oriented discrete event simulator targeted at 
networking research.  ns-2 is written in C++ and OTcl, where 
C++ is used to implement code that needs fast execution, such 
as specific protocol actions, and OTcl is used for less time-
critical functions and to bind the C++ blocks together.  Entire 
networks can be modeled by putting together new and 
existing C++ and OTcl components.
